# Arm Version 1
First iteration of a simple 3 axis robotic arm, built using 9g servos and 3d printing. <br />

The design was adapted from the EEZYbotARM by theGHIZmo which can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/EEZYbotARM/).
Note: An additional O ring will be needed to provide a 5mm offset for SG90 servos.

The project consisted of the assembly of the arm itself plus 3 coding milestones.<br />
1. Manual control with potentiometers<br />
2. Computerized control using trigonometric angles<br />
3. Computerized control using cartesian coordiantes <br />

The .ino files for each milestone are included in this repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/devJim03/robotic-arm-v1/tree/main/Mk%201).
